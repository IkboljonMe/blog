Hello from Ikboljon Abdurasulov! 👋🏻 I'm a [UEHS](https://vizja.pl/en/) student 🧑🏻‍🎓 and Software Engineer 👨🏻‍💻. [Radcode](https://www.radcode.co/) kickstarted my journey into frontend development, and now, I'm exploring the world of backend. [Algorithms](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/javascript-algorithms) satisfy my curiosity. Let's innovate together!

## Currently working on

- My personal site [ikboljon.com](/)
- [LeetCode](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/leetcode) and [algorithms](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/javascript-algorithms) repos.

## Timeline

### 2023

- Dived into the world of data structures and algorithms, working through coding challenges on LeetCode and HackerRank. My [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/ikboljonme/) solutions have been viewed over 50,000 times. Take a look at my [algorithms](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/javascript-algorithms) and [LeetCode](https://github.com/IkboljonMe/leetcode) repositories to see my coding journey.
- Started delving into Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to build a foundation for backend development. Also, checked out PostgreSQL as a relational database and got introduced to Docker for containerization. Developed several projects based on these tools.

### 2022

- Transitioned from mobile to web development, mastering [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) and its frameworks, [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 🔄.
- Finished internship program at [RadCode](https://www.radcode.co/) and thanks for providing the platform to showcase my frontend skills with [React.js](https://react.dev/) 🎉.
- Explored CSS libraries including [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and delved into the world of CSS preprocessors [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Postcss](https://postcss.org/), also correlated frameworks [MUI](https://mui.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) etc 💥.
